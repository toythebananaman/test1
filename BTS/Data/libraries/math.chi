    Functions
        Add
        :
        The sum of the two values.

        Subtract
        :
        The difference between the two values.

        Multiply
        :
        The product of the two values.

        Divide
        :
        The division of the first value by the second value.

        Multiply Add
        :
        The sum of the product of the two values with Addend.

        Power
        :
        The Base raised to the power of Exponent.

        Logarithm
        :
        The log of the value with a Base as its base.

        Square Root
        :
        The square root of the value.

        Inverse Square Root
        :
        One divided by the square root of the value.

        Absolute
        :
        The input value is read without regard to its sign. This turns negative values into positive values.

        Exponent
        :
        Raises Eulerâ€™s number to the power of the value.

    Comparison
        Minimum
        :
        Outputs the smallest of the input values.

        Maximum
        :
        Outputs the largest of two input values.

        Less Than
        :
        Outputs 1.0 if the first value is smaller than the second value. Otherwise the output is 0.0.

        Greater Than
        :
        Outputs 1.0 if the first value is larger than the second value. Otherwise the output is 0.0.

        Sign
        :
        Extracts the sign of the input value. All positive numbers will output 1.0. All negative numbers will output -1.0. And 0.0 will output 0.0.

        Compare
        :
        Outputs 1.0 if the difference between the two input values is less than or equal to Epsilon.

        Smooth Minimum
        :
        Smooth Minimum.

        Smooth Maximum
        :
        Smooth Maximum.

    Rounding
        Round
        :
        Rounds the input value to the nearest integer.

        Floor
        :
        Rounds the input value down to the nearest integer.

        Ceil
        :
        Rounds the input value up to the nearest integer.

        Truncate
        :
        Outputs the integer part of the value.

        Fraction
        :
        Returns the fractional part of the value.

        Modulo
        :
        Outputs the remainder once the first value is divided by the second value.

        Wrap
        :
        Outputs a value between Min and Max based on the absolute difference between the input value and the nearest integer multiple of Max less than the value.

        Snap
        :
        Rounds the input value down to the nearest integer multiple of Increment.

        Ping-pong
        :
        The output value is moved between 0.0 and the Scale based on the input value.

    Trigonometric
        Sine
            :
            The Sine of the input value.

        Cosine
            :
            The Cosine of the input value.

        Tangent
            :
            The Tangent of the input value.

        Arcsine
            :
            The Arcsine of the input value.

        Arccosine
        :
        The Arccosine of the input value.

        Arctangent
        :
        The Arctangent of the input value.

        Arctan2
        :
        Outputs the Inverse Tangent of the first value divided by the second value measured in radians.

        Hyperbolic Sine
        :
        The Hyperbolic Sine of the input value.

        Hyperbolic Cosine
        :
        The Hyperbolic Cosine of the input value.

        Hyperbolic Tangent
            :
            The Hyperbolic Tangent of the input value.

    Conversion
        To Radians
            :
            Converts the input from degrees to radians.

        To Degrees
            :
            Converts the input from radians to degrees.

    Clamp
        Limits the output to the range (0.0 to 1.0). See Clamp.
